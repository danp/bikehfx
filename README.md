## Thanks

Thanks to:

* [Halifax Cycling Coalition](https://cyclehalifax.ca/) and [DalTRAC](http://www.dal.ca/sites/daltrac.html) for the [counter(s) and data](http://www.eco-public.com/ParcPublic/?id=4638#)
* Michael Jones for the [yycbike](https://github.com/Chealion/yycbike) repo

## Ideas

### daily tweet

* total count for the day, top hour?
* whether it was a record
* week/month/year recaps (tops, comparisons to similar time period)

### data capture

* hourly counter data
* weather data?
